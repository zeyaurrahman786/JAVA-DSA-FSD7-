// 33. A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions 
// i. Hardness must be greater than 50 
// ii. Carbon content must be less than 0.7 
// iii. Tensile strength must be greater than 5600 
// The grades are as follows: 
// • Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met 
// • Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met 
// • Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met 
// • Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met 
// • Grade is 6 if only one condition is met 
// • Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met 
// Write a program, which will require the user to give values of hardness, carbon content and 
// tensile strength of the steel under consideration and output the grade of the steel.
